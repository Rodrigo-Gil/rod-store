# RodStore

A clothing e-commerce project

## Description

This project was built using React.js, Redux for the state management as well as Firebase to handle User's sign-up as well as the sign-in features.<br />

The Application was built in components to allow code reusability and further customization if need be.

**Important Note:** The Frontend is fully functional, however, the backend to handle payments is still under development. <br />
On the checkout page, you can find a testing credit card information to simulate payments.
